should_be_immutable:
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- Using replace function for the string, the "original" word inside the string then it was replaced by "new"
2.Why the test failed at first?
- areSame is returning a null value.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because the "of" function of the Optional class returns the same value of it's parameter and originalString is not equal to modifiedString
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- None

all_modification_method_will_create_new_string:
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- Using trim function for the string with whitespace, it was able to eliminate the whitespaces for modifiedString.
2.Why the test failed at first?
- areSame is returning a null value.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- I'm not sure on what is the reason of modifiedString and originalString not being equal after triggering the trim function.
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any factors or why is those 2 variables not equal even after trim?

will_create_new_string_when_concat
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- Using +=  for the string of originalString, it was able to concat the string "Part One" and "Part two"
2.Why the test failed at first?
- areSame is returning a null value.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- I'm not sure on what is the reason of modifiedString and originalString not being equal after triggering the concatenation.
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any factors or why is those 2 variables not equal even after trim?


should_taken_string_apart_continued:
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The knowledge point is to be familiarized with consist function
- https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-string/
2.Why the test failed at first?
- no failed case.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because I think using contains function is the easiest way to success the test
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?

- The knowledge point is to be familiarized with split function
- https://www.edureka.co/blog/split-string-method-in-java/
2.Why the test failed at first?
- no failed case.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because I think using split function is the easiest way to success the test

- https://www.edureka.co/blog/split-string-method-in-java/
2.Why the test failed at first?
- no failed case.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because I think using split function with regex = '/' is the easiest way to success the test
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

should_create_ascii_art
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The knowledge point is to be familiarized with String Builder and Append function
- https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-string/
2.Why the test failed at first?
- no failed case.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because I think using height only instead of using both heigh and weight is the easiest way to success the test
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?

should_calculate_checksum_of_a_string
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- If you convert a char to an int, it will give you its ASCII equivalent
- https://www.javatpoint.com/java-char-to-int
2.Why the test failed at first?
- no failed case.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Because converting a letter to an int will give me the ASCII equivalent of each letters in the string is the easiest way to success the test
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?



should_reverse_a_string
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- used a for loop and charAt to manipulate the string
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_string_charat.htm
2.Why the test failed at first?
- I forgot to assigned the array to descending fashion.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Becuase using a for loop and using the string Index is one way of reversing a string.
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?

should_convert_unicode_escape
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- we can use an escape to display a unicode. Example: "\u306a" for „Å™"
2.Why the test failed at first?
- I keep included the "+" in the unicode.
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Becuase that is the simplest way to display the special characters
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?

should_compare_string_with_different_cases
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The type is also Boolean,  
2.Why the test failed at first?
- No test failure
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Due to the use or function of the format method.
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
- Is there any way for the solution to be more short? And How?


should_format_string
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?

- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_strings.htm
2.Why the test failed at first?
- No test failure
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- Due to the use or function of the format method.
